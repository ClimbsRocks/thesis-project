# CulturedCheese: DigitalNomads (Working Title) #

<!-- 
> This material was originally posted [here](http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management). It is reproduced here for posterities sake.

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
 > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

 Easily search for clusters of capable developers outside of the U.S. and Europe sorted by programming language at the click of a button.

## Sub-Heading ##
 > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

DigitalNomads helps project owners find capable team members and helps digital nomads find communities of similar colleagues and peers.   

## Summary ##
 > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

DigitalNomads provides users with insightful analysis and useful data visualization of GitHub activity around the world by programming language.      
Both project/company owners and members of the growing class (workforce?) of globe-trotting developers will find DigitalNomads useful.  Project owners will be able to more efficiently find clusters of capable programmers in lower cost regions to hire for their projects.  And digital nomads will be able to more easily determine where communities of similarly skilled and capable peers are located while they are planning their travels.   

## Problem ##
 > Describe the problem your product solves.

If I am a project owner looking to develop an web or mobile application in a specific programming language or framework and I want to set up a team of developers based in a part of the world where wages are a fraction of what they are in the U.S. and Europe, there is no tool out there to help me easily determine where clusters of say Javascript or Angular developers are located.  And what sources of information that do exist are either outdated or based on questionable data or data gathering methodologies.  

At the same time, there is a growing trend towards software professionals from Western nations who are choosing a location-independent lifestyle that allows them to travel and work anywhere in the world.

Often times, these “digital nomads” are looking for clusters of similar developers in order to find a sense of community and opportunities for collaboration while on their travels.  DigitalNomads easily provides them with a list of the top 3 cities in each region of the world where they will find like-minded and similarly skilled colleagues.  
 
## Solution ##
 > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

DigitalNomads analyzes repositories and commits on GitHub, the largest code host in the world, to determine which programming languages are most popular and active in each part of the world.  By packaging this data in an insightful and useful format, DigitalNomads makes it easy for both project owners and nomadic developers to access and filter this information to meet their needs.

Phase II:  Add on features / integrations such as AirBnB, Odesk, Yelp/Google Maps, etc

## Quote from You ##
 > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
 
“GitHub data visualizations! Need I say more!?!?!" 

## How to Get Started ##
 > Describe how easy it is to get started.
 
Please visit www.digitalnomads.com to have your mind blown. 

## Customer Quote ##
 > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

“I never knew there were so many capable (insert technology here) developers in Santiago, Chile.  After using digitalnomads.com, I’m going to hire a team down there for my next project!” 

"I didn't know how many other Javascript developers lived in Bali until today.  Should be a great place to work and live for a few months.  Just bought my plane ticket!" 

## Closing and Call to Action ##
 > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

We've made it incredibly easy to determine where clusters of capable, non-U.S. / non-Europe -based developers live and filter these communities by the dominant programming language used in that region. Visit digitalnomads.com to see what all the fuss is about!
