## What is it?

DigitalNomads provides users with insightful analysis and useful data visualization of GitHub activity around the world by programming language.      
Both project/company owners and members of the growing class (workforce?) of globe-trotting developers will find DigitalNomads useful.  Project owners will be able to more efficiently find clusters of capable programmers in lower cost regions to hire for their projects.  And digital nomads will be able to more easily determine where communities of similarly skilled and capable peers are located while they are planning their travels. 

DigitalNomads analyzes repositories and commits on GitHub, the largest code host in the world, to determine which programming languages are most popular and active in each part of the world.  By packaging this data in an insightful and useful format, DigitalNomads makes it easy for both project owners and nomadic developers to access and filter this information to meet their needs.
